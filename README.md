# 🏷 WIDGET GENERATOR 5000 YO

No but like seriously, maybe you want some data to tool around with?


## USE IT STRAIGHT-UP

````ruby
WidgetGenerator::WidgetManager.generate_widgets # <= array of 100 widgets!
````

## GET JSON DATA TO TOOL AROUND WITH

````ruby
WidgetGenerator::WidgetManager.serialize_widgets_to_jzon # <= 100 widgets serializes to json!
````

## GET MONGODB DATA TO TOOL AROUND WITH

````ruby
WidgetGenerator::WidgetManager.serialize_widgets_for_mongodb # <= 100 widgets serialized for MongoDB!
````

## BUILD IT (I ALREADY DID) AND INSTALL IT (LIKE YOU MEAN IT)

````bash
# build
/me/widget-generator-5000$ gem build widget_generator_gem.gemspec

# install
/me/widget-generator-5000$ gem install widget-generator-5000-2.gem

# confirm
gem list
````

# Use

````ruby
#my_file.rb
require 'widget-generator-5000'
````

## 🤑 PROFIT

## DON'T JUDGE ME

Slides away under the bed.
